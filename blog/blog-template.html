How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

We agreed that there were some challenges with the wireframing, particularly since we had different needs for our websites. But overall, we had a good time. I think we both enjoyed the HTML more than the wireframing, though we also agreed that we are still learning a lot about the semantic aspects of HTML. It's very easy to get the elements out there in h1, h2, p, etc., but it's another thing to transparently communicate the structure of a document.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, although I definitely think we will need to re-wireframe later when we better understand how easy/hard different layouts are to actually implement in CSS. So I'm glad we limited our investment here to about 10 minutes - just creating enough of a concept to have something to pair with. I can see that being true in many cases - you need a rough draft to get you started, but you're going to have redo it later anyway.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We felt it was important to have the nav at the top, and to have most of the focus of the page (not surprisingly) on the text. We did add a picture and description to the right, which I think will liven things up a bit.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I didn't learn anything new per se, though I applied some of these things and learned what I did and didn't know. For instance, I learned that while I get the concept of a section, it's not always clear where the section dividers go relative to other HTML elements. Does a header (i.e. h1-h6) precede a section or is it contained within it? I've realized there is a lot of research I'll need to do to get really comfortable with this - the challenge is going to be continuing to practice with it as much as possible.
