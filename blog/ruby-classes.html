        Given how strongly object-oriented Ruby is, writing your own classes is a big deal and a crucial part of using the language well. Today we'll do an intro to classes and using instance objects and variables.
    </p>
    <p>
        The wonderful thing about object-oriented programming is that programming becomes much less an exercise in Arrays, Hashes, variable types and other arcane terminology and much more about reasoning about things that you already know. Consider watching a movie, perhaps with your family. All movies have properties that you can name without even thinking about it. They have titles, they have genres, they have run-times, they have groups of leads/main actors. Similarly, movies can DO things. For instance, you could play a movie. Or perhaps you could rewind it (we're going retro here). So, a movie is an object that is associated with certain attributes and certain actions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In programming, we get to make these "properties" and "methods" explicit as part of defining a class. By writing a class, we create the fundamental definition of what it means to be a movie. It's a lot of fun, and a powerful feature of most programming languages. Let's check it out.
    </p>
    <p>
        To declare a Movie, we have to clarify what it takes to instantiate an new movie object, or make a new version of one. So the simplest version of a movie class (besides a completely empty class) is:

        <pre><code>
            class Movie
                def initialize(title)
                end
            end
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        What we've done here is say that a basic movie has at minimum a title, and that any new movie should be instantiated or created with it. But we actually haven't done anything useful with the title above. To make it more accessible, so that we can refer to a particular movie's title, we need to a) create an instance variable for the title, and b) define how to access that property. That might look more like this:

        <pre><code>
            class Movie
                def initialize(title)
                    @title = title
                end

                def title
                    return @title
                end
            end
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now "title" is something that we can refer to. For any movie we create, we can access the title via <code>example_movie.title</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We might want to have other variables associated with a given instance of an object, that maybe are defined by default upon initialization. For instance, let's define an instance variable called @playback that tracks where we are in a movie. At the beginning, it's always 0. But we can define a method called play that adds 1 to @playback - in other words, we've watched one chapter of the DVD. Now our class looks like this:
        <pre><code>
            class Movie
                def initialize(title)
                    @title = title
                    @playback = 0
                end

                def title
                    return @title
                end

                def play
                    @playback += 1
                end
            end
        </code></pre>

    </p>
    <p>
        Now we can call <code>example_movie.play</code> the same way we called <code>example_movie.title</code>. What's the real difference between the two, you might ask? Not much. A method and a property operate more or less the same; the difference is largely semantic.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you can tell from everything we've seen above, the class is really just a blueprint. We actually create movies via declarations like:

        <pre><code>
            my_movie = Movie.new("The Muppet Christmas Carol")
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        And now as mentioned before, we might make a series of other calls to interact with the instance of the movie we just created:
        <pre><code>
            puts my_movie.title
            => "The Muppet Christmas Carol"
            my_movie.play
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Play doesn't do much for us right now since we can't actually see the impact of calling it. We could rectify this by defining "def playback" the same way that we defined title, but here's a little Ruby shortcut. We can use something called attr_reader that implicitly defines an instance variable like @playback.
    </p>
    <p>
        <pre><code>
            class Movie
                attr_reader :playback

                def initialize(title)
                    @title = title
                    @playback = 0
                end

                def title
                    return @title
                end

                def play
                    @playback += 1
                end
            end
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now after the preceding calls, we could write:

        <pre><code>
            puts my_movie.playback
            => 1
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        So we now have a movie with properties, like title or playback, and methods, like play. We could continue to write many other properties and methods to flesh out Movie, bounded only by imagination and the needs of the particular problem at hand. But what I hope I've illustrated in this post is that if you can think about an object in real life, you can probably write code for it as well!
