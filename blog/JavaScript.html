    <h2>Looping in JavaScript vs. Ruby</h2>

        Looping in Ruby and JavaScript is actually much more similar than different. Let's take a look.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similar constructs exist in both languages. For instance, you can iterate with a <code>for</code> or a <code>while</code> loop in both languages, and the concept is essentially identical. Similarly, you can use an iterator or enumerator method like <code>each</code> in Ruby or <code>forEach</code> in JavaScript - these cycle through an enumerable object like an array or hash/object. Ruby's syntax is easier on the eyes, and there are more built-in iterative methods than in JavaScript, but the basic looping options are the same.
    </p>
    <p>
       The real difference comes from convention. In Ruby, it is very idiomatic to use the <code>each</code> method to loop through any enumerable object; in fact, I haven't seen anyone use a <code>for</code> loop in any real code. Whereas in JavaScript, it's pretty common to use for loops (as it is in many languages), and <code>ForEach</code> seems to be a bit more obscure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's just take a quick look at the syntaxes for Ruby and for JavaScript to print the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ruby:
        <pre><code>
        for i in (1..10)
          puts i
        end</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript:
        <pre><code>
        for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {
          console.log(i);
        }</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        And now with an iterator method:
        Ruby:
        <pre><code>
        (1..10).each { |i| puts i }
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript:
        <pre><code>
        var a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]; // Note that it's a bit harder to generate ranges in JavaScript
        //than in Ruby, so we'll just start with an array here
        a.forEach(function(i) { console.log(i) });
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        The other JavaScript limitation besides aesthetics (in my humble opinion) is that the <code>ForEach</code> method is only supported for arrays, so different methods are needed for objects or for entities that are merely array-like. That said, for many situations (as so often seems to be the case with different programming languages), the syntax will be the biggest difference.
