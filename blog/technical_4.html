        Data structures! Arrays and hashes, kids. Let's start with arrays. Arrays are ordered lists of elements. They can contain almost any element, including other arrays, and you can mix and match 'em. So for example:
        <pre><code>my_array = [1,2,"Three",4.0,"V"]</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Arrays are great for simpler lists where order is important and there is no obvious "key" to access an item besides a numeric index with no semantic meaning. So for example, if I just wanted to store a list of my favorite movies without any other information, I'd just do:
        <pre><code>my_movies = ["Saving Private Ryan","Fight Club","Waking Life","E.T."]</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        And so on. Disclaimer: not actually my favorite movies. Then to access any given element of the array, I can reference it by its index number. Index numbers start at 0 in Ruby, so <code>my_movies[0]</code> references "Saving Private Ryan", <code>my_movies[1]</code> references "Fight Club", and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many other ways to access array elements, filter to sub elements, aggregate across elements, and so on, but life is short as is my attention span so let's talk about hashes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hashes have other names in other languages (for instance, dicts or dictionaries in Python, or hash browns in English). Hashes feel like lists in some ways, but the key difference with a hash is an associated key for every value. So rather than just a list of elements with a non-semantic index to retrieve them, hashes are a (usually) unordered list of key-value pairs, where I can feed the hash a key and get back the corresponding value. For instance:
      <pre><code>movie_dates = {
        "Saving Private Ryan": 1998,
        "Fight Club": 1999,
        "Waking Life": 2001,
        "E.T.": 1982}</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this hash, the keys are on the left, and the years they were made are on the right (disclaimer: still not my favorite movies). So if I try to access the hash with one of the keys - supposed I want to know when Waking Life was made - I just type <code>movie_dates["Waking Life"]</code>, and the hash gives me back 2001.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pretty cool, right? The downside with hashes, besides the name, is that they are by default undordered. There are various workarounds for this, but fundamentally they are unordered, chaotic creatures. But hashes are probably better than arrays if order doesn't matter and when the key is semantically useful for retrieving the value/information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, the party really starts when you start combining the two. What if we want to track the holiday wish lists of all of our extended relatives and retrieve their wishes upon command? Use a pen and paper! But if you wanted to code something to do it, you could have a hash with your relative's names as the key and an array of their gift wishes as the value. Or suppose you want a list of all of the runners in a race as they finish, including some additional information like their height, age, or American Airlines rewards number - make an array where each item is a hash containing that kind of information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arrays and hashes can be simple or complicated depending on they're feeling that morning, but they are the building blocks of a lot of the data storage and manipulation you will use in Ruby (or most languages), so ply them liberally with coffee and you'll be fine.
