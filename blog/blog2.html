How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

We agreed that there were some challenges with the wireframing, particularly since we had different needs for our websites. I had to spend time later making more edits to make my various pages more compatible. But overall, we had a good time. I think we both enjoyed the HTML more than the wireframing, though we also agreed that we are still learning a lot about the semantic aspects of HTML. It's very easy to get the elements out there in h1, h2, p, etc., but it's another thing to transparently communicate the structure of a document.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, although I definitely think we will need to re-wireframe later when we better understand how easy/hard different layouts are to actually implement in CSS. So I'm glad we limited our investment here to about 10 minutes - just creating enough of a concept to have something to pair with. I can see that being true in many cases - you need a rough draft to get you started, but you're going to have redo it later anyway.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We felt it was important to have the nav at the top, and to have most of the focus of the page (not surprisingly) on the text. We did add a picture and description to the right, which I think will liven things up a bit.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I didn't learn anything new per se, though I applied some of these things and learned what I did and didn't know. For instance, I learned that while I get the concept of a section, it's not always clear where the section dividers go relative to other HTML elements. Does a header (i.e. h1-h6) precede a section or is it contained within it? I've realized there is a lot of research I'll need to do to get really comfortable with this - the challenge is going to be continuing to practice with it as much as possible.

        Perhaps there will be an intro post sometime later... but for now, we're going to dive right in. I'll be writing a bit about my experiences with git, GitHub, and the command line, which were the core parts of the curriculum for DBC this first week of Phase 0.
    </p>
    <p>
        The big theme for this week was that previous exposure to the concepts helped them really sink in this time around. I suspect that will be a recurring pattern through DBC - it may take a few rehearsals before something really becomes intuitive. I think that's actually a pretty fundamental part of learning that I try to weasel my way out of sometimes, but in the end, there is no substitute for practice, or as my boss likes to say, "additional reps." I actually think it's an encouraging sign, very much aligne d with growth-mindset thinking: there is no concept you can't understand as long as you keep at it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had been exposed to all three topics previously in my CS adventures, both through chance encounters and through my deliberate attempts to learn them. I've been through at least one mini-CLI course, and I'd read a few git/GitHub tutorials previously. I knew these were fundamental tools in the developer toolkit, but like foreign languages, they don't stick when you don't feel you have a need to use them. Why use version control when you're building small programs that don't play together? Why bother with a command line interface when I have a perfectly good GUI? And I think I could still defend that line of reasoning - the average person probably doesn't need to know the ins and outs of rmdir - but it's certainly the case that I'll need to know them soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        And that leads me to the benefits of version control. The most important advantages seem to be:
          1. the ability to jump back to previous versions with good documentation of each snapshot.
          2. the ability to create separate branches so that multiple people can work in parallel and add their contributions without putting the integrity/functionality of the master version at risk.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a shame you don't get these in more software programs. In an interesting parallel, one of my co-workers who has a CS background has been pushing recently for a git-style version control system for Excel. I work as a consultant for a nonprofit that, among other things, analyzes spending patterns for school districts. Our current method is simply to append a version number to each instance of a file (e.g. v31) and take care not to be working on parallel aspects of the program that can't be easily incorporated. There's no documentation of what changed with each step, and no easy way to get the team working in parallel on the same file. I know git is primarily used for text-based documents, and I've heard there are some challenges with other documents (for instance, Excel files), but I'm curious to see if the barrier here is technical or educational - most people just aren't used to thinking about versioning this way.
    </p>
    <p>
        I do think it's a bit harder to wrap your head around good GitHub workflow than it is around v1, v2... v153, etc., so my contribution to this topic will be a metaphor for understanding the full GitHub workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine communication patterns in the armed forces. We've got army headquarters, which is the version on GitHub, and we've got a regiment in enemy territory, which is your local repository.
            </p>
    <p>
        Creating a branch and making changes to the file, commits, etc. is like scouting. When you find new information about the terrain or enemy position, you need to let everyone know so that that information can get incorporated in military decision-making everywhere, not just in your tiny corner of the world.
            </p>
    <p>
        So you hop on the radio and send a message to HQ. That's pushing your code up to GitHub. Once you've done that, the radio operator at HQ will have some new information to take to the Chief Commanding Officer to reconcile with various other reports from the field. That's the pull request.
            </p>
    <p>
        Once that information is reconciled with other available information, the Chief Commanding Officer knows as much as anyone else knows about the situation and is equipped to make all decisions; in other words, the remote master is the most up-to-date, final version of the code. He/she then sends that knowledge in the form of orders and information to the colonels and lieutenants of various regiments, so that they too are up-to-date and everyone is on the same page. That's pulling the remote master into the local master.
            </p>
    <p>
        It's not the cleanest metaphor out there... but hopefully by thinking about it this way, it's easier to remember what the next step needs to be to keep your troops in the loop/code up-to-date.
