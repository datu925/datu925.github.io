      <p>I'm a man of many interests: while I focused on math and theater in high school, I studied psychology at Yale and then worked in the education sector as a nonprofit consultant for the first three and a half years after I graduated. Now, behold my latest reinvention: I'm attending Dev Bootcamp in order to expand on my coding skills and pursue a career as a developer.</p>
      <p>While this is my first foray into software as the focus of my career, I have been programming on and off since college, when I was first introduced to Java, Scheme, and C. I began to work in Python to help automate one of my company's more challenging data processes, which culminated in my serving as company lead in a data science competition. I finally started with Ruby as I began to explore building web applications for my company, and it became clear that the writing was on the wall: it was time for me to pursue a career in development full-on.</p>
      <p>As much as I enjoy Codecademy, sometimes you need to turn things up a notch. So I decided to enroll in Dev Bootcamp in order to accelerate my development and get ready to embrace a whole new way of looking at the world and my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I like to play frisbee, cook, and work out. The weirdest things about me are that I can't/don't burp and that I used to sing a cappella in college.
