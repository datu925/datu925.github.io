                  <h2>Income, Spending, and Years to Retirement</h2>
                    <p>I'm interested in early retirement (aka the FIRE movement) and made a chart that shows the impact of spending and income on how long it takes you to retire. Hoping to expand this to become a visual introduction to FIRE principles. The chart was built with Plotly.js.</p>

                <h2>CTA Analysis</h2>
                  <p>I played around with Chicago's open data portal and created a map of the city's train lines with the width of each line corresponding to its ridership. You can also use the year slider to see how it changes over time. See the <a href="cta_analysis/methodology.html">methodology page</a> for more details.</p>

                <h2>Box-Plots for Education</h2>
                  <p>Before I was a developer, I worked as a strategy consultant for an education nonprofit called <a href="www.erstrategies.org">Education Resource Strategies</a>. While I was there, I led the ERS side of a partnership with <a href="www.drivendata.org">DrivenData</a>, an organization that (among their many talents) coordinates data science competitions like those on Kaggle, but with a social impact slant. You can see my letter to the competitors on the DrivenData website, as well as the results of the competition.</p>
                  <p>This project really awakened my interest in data science, which I now approach with a more technical perspective. I've continued to work with ERS to improve the algorithm that came out of the competition.</p>
