#1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I felt by the end like I had pretty good command of the box model and knew, at least in the abstract, how to manipulate padding, borders, and margin. I don't know that I learned anything, but getting the chance to practice was really helpful.

#2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?

It can be very frustrating! And there are usually multiple ways of doing everything. I feel like I could use a lot more challenges to force the logic into my brain. I did gain a lot of appreciation for very simple but effective website designs.

#3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Getting my projects list to look the way I wanted it to happened pretty easily.

I struggled with the sidebar for a while, since I wasn't sure whether I wanted it to be fixed, or to be a float. I went with a float, though I can still imagine changing it later to be a float. I also had to go through a lot of grief to get the nav links to be in line with the title. And I really wanted to add a single pipe character (e.g. About Me | Blog | Contact) between them, which I've always thought to be a cool look, but I couldn't find a way to do it in CSS.

#4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

Personally, I found that while it's good to keep design in CSS and structure and content in HTML, you'll often want to have them both available anyway... it's easy to get dogmatic, but for a beginner, often just switching the order in the HTML was a much easier fix than trying to figure out how to do something wacky in CSS. I also am waiting to hear what the big secret is to making websites that DON'T look like they were made in 2002 - that is, it feels like there's a fundamental ceiling to how nifty my website can be with these tools. Is that bootstrap or another CSS framework? Or Javascript? I don't know.
