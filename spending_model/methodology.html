    <h1>Methodology</h1>

    <p>Data is directionally accurate but required some imputation, as average spending was given for each decile rather than at the percentile level.</p>

    <p>When you mouse over the chart, you should be able to see both percentile information as well as the absolute dollar figure.</p>
